From William Dingo
==================
It's true I didn't like how your original chapter one with Sarah went, But it still felt like she was cut out when something could be done about it to include her side.

I was inspired to write some fic of Sarah's sudden death, and how she felt uncertain in life on the boat before charging into attack the orcs. The fic is incomplete and inconsistent, 1k-ish.

Anyways, I was thinking, what if she was in limbo, and the thong that Brick took was an important anchor making her unable to pass on to proper death, because of all the disruption of the lich king. Every now and then, she visits Brick's dreams, unintentionally, and realises that it's the thong that's holding her back. Brick doesn't realise this, and is instead struggling with the dreams until he meets the... I think it's goblin elder across the sea? (The name I lost, apologies). He manages to properly pinpoint its issue.

The tension of this part is that the longer she stays in limbo, the more her sould/spirit is torn from the strain, and could end up being like a tortured ghost, which could cause problems for brick, who has no magical means to fight her.

As for general notes
* I'm willing to accept that names and descriptions are hard for me to take in, it took me a looong time to realise that goblins were only about 2ft tall, and there's not an easy comparison for me to pick up on usually.
* the rope game threw me off, I couldn't understand what they were doing, only that Brick lost 2-1
* You could definitely add more for Urlug to let readers feel more compassion/dispair at the loss. Maybe make him succeed in tripping up Brick with home-made traps that are clever, just ineffective against a minotaur. e.g. clothesline snagging, swinging buckets of water, rubbish and refuse flung at him before Urlug realises it's an ally that's coming in.
* I felt Squinty holding Brick ransom was a touch too far to believe, but it really holds up as a plot point if you can manage to swing it. 
* I feel you could have also worked up Azgala's section, to bring up unease, and tension a bit more depending on how spooky you want that part to feel. 
  * Mayhaps his death could trigger an extremely strong presence to meet with Sarah as Mort's basically dreading the repercussions every day when he'll be pointed at. Since he has learnt limited common, and in the presence of the limbo where thoughts are present strongly, he could get some kind of inkling as to what a place looks like. This could be tied into parts if Molthor was, for example, to lose the directional ping to the spot of interest, or it leads to the wrong spot, further tension to add if desired.
* It would be nice to have more than one point to reference 'mortar', perhaps linking in Johnny's (which is strangely not orcish or tauren in name) relation to the lich to link further to limbo
* Your descriptions were great, and I really love the feel of Brick explaining it rather than a narrator doing it. I love the personal feel of it. 
* I always am keen to explore the inequality/expectations of someone that lives to 20 vs someone that lives to 60 (rough guess for orcs)
* And I do look forward to seeing more in regards to Brick's sisters.
